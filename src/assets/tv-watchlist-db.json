Adam feels fully equipped to take on more parenting responsibilities while his self-assured wife, Andi, returns to the workforce after being a stay-at-home mom for 13 years. However, Adam is blindsided by how tough it is to wrangle three messy kids who can't live without Wi-Fi. Their preteen daughter, Kate, is a master manipulator and initially thrilled that \"Daddy Fun Times\" is taking over, middle child Teddy can't seem to keep his hands out of his pants despite constant reminders, and their precious youngest, Emme, is nervous about starting kindergarten under the stern supervision of Mrs. Rodriguez. In the midst of it all, Adam's older brother and business partner, Don, enjoys giving him terrible advice about how to run his family. But, with Andi's encouragement and advice from a couple of equally stressed parents, Marie and Lowell, Adam takes charge of his brood, lays down the law and discovers he's going to \"nail\" this job.

Detective Steve McGarrett, a decorated Naval officer-turned-cop, returned to Oahu to investigate his father's murder and stayed after Hawaii's former governor persuaded him to head up the new team: his rules, no red tape and full blanket authority to hunt down the biggest \"game\" in town. Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p>","cast":[],"schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Friday"]},"user_rating":{"average":8,"count":0},"content_rating":"TV-14","channel":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"api_source":"tvmaze","api_id":{"tvmaze":24,"tvrage":24840,"thetvdb":164541,"imdb":"tt1600194","zap2it":"EP01280063","trakt":0,"tmdb":0},"image":{"banner":["http://www.thetvdb.com/banners/graphical/164541-g5.jpg"],"poster":["http://www.thetvdb.com/banners/posters/164541-15.jpg","http://www.thetvdb.com/banners/posters/164541-14.jpg","http://www.thetvdb.com/banners/posters/164541-1.jpg","http://www.thetvdb.com/banners/posters/164541-12.jpg","http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/0/294.jpg","http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/25/64995.jpg","http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/25/64995.jpg"]},"unseen_count":0,"first_episode":{"episode_id":"tvmaze24_0001_0001_0001","show_id":"tvmaze24","local_showtime":1285034400000,"name":"'Pailaka (Pilot)","url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1314/hawaii-five-0-1x01-pailaka-pilot","iso8601":"2010-09-20T22:00:00-04:00","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season":1,"number":1,"counter":1,"special":false,"guest_stars":"","director":"","writer":"","summary":"<p>Upon returning to Hawaii to investigate his father's murder, decorated Naval officer Steve McGarrett is recruited by the Governor to head up an elite new police task force - his rules, her backing, no red tape.

With no other options and time winding down, Michael takes drastic measures to get himself incarcerated alongside his brother in Fox River State Penitentiary. Once he's inside, Michael - a structural engineer with the blueprints for the prison - begins to execute an elaborate plan to break Lincoln out and prove him innocent. When Michael arrives at Fox River State Penitentiary, he meets the prison denizens who will, unknowingly, help in his escape plans - his cellmate, the lovelorn Sucre; beautiful prison doctor Dr. Sara Tancredi, who happens to be the governor's daughter; former mob boss John Abruzzi; and Warden Henry Pope.

This week \"Dancing with the Stars\" has chosen to spotlight dancer Michaela DePrince. She was born in Sierra Leone and her parents died in the conflicts there when she was very young, so Michaela ended up in an orphanage. She always wanted to dance, but never had the opportunity. She finally got her chance when she was adopted by an American couple a few years later. Her mother enrolled her in ballet classes and Michaela excelled! Recently she earned a scholarship to the JKO School at American Ballet Theater and she is soon hoping to become a principal in a ballet company. Her story is featured in the award-winning documentary, \"First Position,\" by Bess Kargman, which follows six young dancers as they prepare for a chance to enter the world of professional ballet, struggling through bloodied feet, near exhaustion and debilitating injuries all while navigating the drama of adolescence. \"First Position,\" directed and produced by Bess Kargman from Sundance Selects, will be released May 4, 2012. During her performance on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" Michaela will be dancing with Ade Chike Torbert, who competed on \"SYTYCD.\" Natasha Bedingfield will be performing live with Michaela, singing her powerful hit song \"Wild Horses.\".</p>","image":{"banner":[],"poster":[]},"seen":true,"previous_id":"tvmaze71_0256_0014_0010","next_id":"tvmaze71_0258_0014_0012","api_source":"tvmaze","api_id":{"tvmaze":3876,"tvrage":0,"thetvdb":0,"imdb":0,"zap2it":0,"trakt":0,"tmdb":0}},"tvmaze71_0258_0014_0012":{"episode_id":"tvmaze71_0258_0014_0012","show_id":"tvmaze71","local_showtime":1335830400000,"name":"Episode 12","url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/3877/dancing-with-the-stars-14x12-episode-12","iso8601":"2012-04-30T20:00:00-04:00","production_code":"","runtime":120,"season":14,"number":12,"counter":258,"special":false,"guest_stars":"","director":"","writer":"","summary":"<p>Joshua Bell has enchanted audiences worldwide with his breathtaking virtuosity and tone of rare beauty, earning him the title \"classical music superstar.\" An Avery Fisher Prize recipient and Musical America's 2010 Instrumentalist of the Year, Bell is the Academy of St Martin in the Fields' newly named Music Director.
